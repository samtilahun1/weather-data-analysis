# Weather Pattern Analysis (2016-2025)
Analysis of 10 years of daily weather data from BWI Airport to identify temperature trends, seasonal patterns in precipitation and temperature, and extreme weather events.


## 📊 Project Overview
This project uses Python to analyze **3,653 days** of weather observations from the Greater DC Metro Area (BWI Airport Station).

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.13**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization

## 📁 Files in This Repository

- `Local_Weather_Patterns.ipynb` - Main analysis notebook
- `4214805.csv` - Raw weather data from NOAA


## 🗂️ Data Source

**NOAA Climate Data**  
Station: BWI Airport (Station #4214805)  
Period: January 1, 2016 - December 31, 2025

## 🔍 Key Findings
When looking at the average temp by month, the chart looks to have a normal distribution with the summer months having the highest temperature as expected. The average precipitation by month showed spring and summer months with the most precipitation as anticipated, with a notable spike between June and July

Looking at the Average Yearly Temperature, the average temperature has increased by over 2°F from 2016 to 2023, but has since gone down, with the average temperature difference in 2016 compared to 2025 being ~-0.4°F. Interestingly, 2018 and 2025 have the lowest recorded temperatures within the decade, both sitting around ~56.7°F.

Lastly, the Number of Extreme Weather Days by Year chart shows us that 2019 had the most extreme weather days, with a whopping 30. However, 2018 had the most extreme cold days with 12 compared to 2019's 6.
